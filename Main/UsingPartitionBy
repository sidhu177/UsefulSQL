Supposing you want to get aggregation with respect to a dimension Parition BY can act wonders to get desired aggregation

```
SELECT Dimension1
    ,  DateValue
    ,  SUM(Measure) Agg
    ,  SUM(Measure) OVER(PARTITION BY Dimension1 ORDER BY DateValue DESC) AggPerDim1
FROM Table
GROUP BY Dimension1, DateValue
ORDER BY DateValue DESC
```
